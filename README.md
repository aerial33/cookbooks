## Cookbook-app ruby

Cookbook application that manages your recipes.
you love cooking, but you need to remember all the recipes you like. This is your cookbook! It'll keep a list of your recipes, allowing you to `list` them, `add` new recipes and `delete` others.

Simply in your terminal:

```bash
ruby app.rb
```

Happy cooking ! ðŸ˜‰
